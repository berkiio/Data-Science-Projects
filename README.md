## Finished and ongoing data science projects ##
Please note that, while reading this, I am continuously learning new ways to write more efficient code and use more sophisticated methods in R. Some older projects may containt chunks of code that seem inefficient. This is due to my straightforward approach to programming. My aim is not always to find the most aesthetically pleasing solution immediately but to continue working, which is why sometimes I wrote a loop for an already existing function that I didn't know at this point in time. Furthermore, my Code is not always the tidiest as a lot of these files are work in progress. More files are coming soon.

## Master Thesis ##
The file (Code_MA_David_Annoni)[https://github.com/berkiio/Data-Science-Projects/blob/main/Code_MA_David_Annoni.R] contains all work related to my master's thesis. Necessary external files (CSV, etc.) will be provided shortly. The interesting parts are up to ~line 445. Thereafter it is mostly just plots and graphical works.

[https://github.com/berkiio/Data-Science-Projects/blob/main/Master_Thesis_Revised.pdf] and [https://github.com/berkiio/Data-Science-Projects/blob/main/Thesis_David_Annoni.pdf] are both containing my master thesis. Currently I am rewriting my thesis in LaTeX, whereas the other file contains the finished thesis. The Revised thesis is currently a work in progress (but most of the original contents are available). Please note that there may be some mistakes in the work in progress file :). All data for my thesis can be found here [https://github.com/berkiio/Data-Science-Projects/blob/main/data.rar].

## Side projects ##
The file (Machine_Learning_and_NLP)[https://github.com/berkiio/Data-Science-Projects/blob/main/Machine%20Learning%20and%20NLP.R] contains work related to the usage of machine learning and neural networks for the classification of twitter sentiment. The labeled dataset can be found here [https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kazanova/sentiment140]. <br />
[https://github.com/berkiio/Data-Science-Projects/blob/main/Statistical%20Methods.R] containts some modern methods for causal inference applied to the stock market (GSC). 
The file (Trading_bot.R)[https://github.com/berkiio/Data-Science-Projects/blob/main/Trading_bot.R] containts a first attempt at writing a crypto trading bot. Later this will be expanded to an equity tradng bot. But first, we use some simple technical methods to identify trading patterns.
